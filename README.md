You are given an integer c representing c power stations, each with a unique identifier id from 1 to c (1‑based indexing).
These stations are interconnected via n bidirectional cables, represented by a 2D array connections, where each element connections[i] = [ui, vi] indicates a connection between station ui and station vi. Stations that are directly or indirectly connected form a power grid.
Initially, all stations are online (operational).
You are also given a 2D array queries, where each query is one of the following two types:
[1, x]: A maintenance check is requested for station x. If station x is online, it resolves the check by itself. If station x is offline, the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id in the same power grid as x. If no operational station exists in that grid, return -1.
[2, x]: Station x goes offline (i.e., it becomes non-operational).
Return an array of integers representing the results of each query of type [1, x] in the order they appear.
Note: The power grid preserves its structure; an offline (non‑operational) node remains part of its grid and taking it offline does not alter connectivity.
